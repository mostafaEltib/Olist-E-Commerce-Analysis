# Olist-E-Commerce-Analysis

This dataset was generously provided by Ecommerce shop called Olist, the largest department store in marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over country to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners.  After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.
## Data Schema
